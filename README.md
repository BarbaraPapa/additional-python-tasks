**<span style="color: windowtext;">Task for Students: Build Your Own Flight Data System</span>**

**<span style="color: windowtext;">Objective:</span>**

<span style="color: windowtext;">Students will create a program that:</span>

1.  Stores flight data for multiple aircraft using dictionaries.
2.  Processes and displays the flight data using a function.
3.  Enhances their understanding of composite data types, functions, and loops.

**<span style="color: windowtext;">Task Description:</span>**

<span style="color: windowtext;">You will design a program to manage and display flight data for multiple aircraft. Each aircraft should have the following attributes:</span>

- **Aircraft Name** (e.g., "Flight A123")
- **Latitude** (e.g., 37.7749)
- **Longitude** (e.g., -122.4194)
- **Speed** (e.g., 500 knots)
- **Heading** (e.g., 90Â°)
- **Altitude** (e.g., 35000 ft)
- **Status** (e.g., "In Flight", "Landed", "Delayed")

* * *

**<span style="color: windowtext;">Requirements:</span>**

1.  **Create a List of Dictionaries**:

- Each dictionary will represent one aircraft and its attributes.

3.  **Write a Function to Process Data**:

- Define a function display_flight_data() that accepts the list of dictionaries and prints details for each aircraft.

5.  **Use a Loop**:

- Use a for loop to process each dictionary in the list and pass it to the display_flight_data() function.

7.  **Enhancement**:

- Add a feature to filter and display only aircraft with a specific status (e.g., only "In Flight" aircraft).

**<span style="color: windowtext;">Task Steps:</span>**

1.  **Write the Code**:

- Create the list of dictionaries for multiple aircraft.
- Write the display_flight_data() function.
- Use a loop to display data for all aircraft.
- Add filtering functionality to display only selected aircraft statuses.

3.  **Run the Program**:

- Test with at least three different aircraft.

5.  **Enhance the Program**

- Allow users to add new aircraft dynamically by accepting input from the console.
- Allow users to update the status of an aircraft.
